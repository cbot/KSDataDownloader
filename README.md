Silk
======

Silk is a thin layer on top of NSURLSession. While it may not be as sophisticated as a full featured HTTP library such as AFNetworking, it does a good job of abstracting the most commonly used functions when talking to an app backend server. Silk is very lightweight and does not bloat your project with unneccesary stuff.


## Installation
Use CocoaPods to add Silk to your project. Just add the following line to your Podfile.
```
pod 'Silk', '~> 3.1.0'
```
